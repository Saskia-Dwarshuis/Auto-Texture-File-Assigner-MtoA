## Automatic Texture File Assigner (for Maya and Arnold's aiStandardSurface)

### The Why

Having to assign texture files to aiStandardSurface is not fun. Creating each file node, assigning each file path, and changing the file color space as needed is tedious work that often takes more time than it should. *AutoTextureFileAssignerMtoA.py* is a script designed to mostly automate this process for you.
