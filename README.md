# Automatic Texture File Assigner (for Maya and Arnold's aiStandardSurface)

## The Why (has this been made?)

## The What (is this, really?)

## The How (should I use this?)


Do you ever get frustrated with assigning textures to aiStandsardSurface? Does having to create each file node, assign each file path, and change the file color space as needed take more time than it should? Are minutes of your day wasted on the tedium of clicking things that really should not need to be clicked? Well fear no more!



Tested in Maya 2020/Python 2.7.11. Backwards or forwards compatibility with different Maya or Python versions is not guaranteed.
